# spacex

This is a simple application to browse the Spacex launch missions, built with react and redux. You can filter the mission listing through various filters like launch year, successful launch, successful landing. You will also have reset button below the filter section to reset the filter.

I have deployed the production build of this app to the AWS ec2 instance on a node js server.
